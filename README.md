# transformer-design
Design of 456 KVA , 3-phase, 50 Hz, 11000/415V, Delta-Wye distribution transformer. Tappings ±2.5, ±5 on high voltage side. Colling on (Oil-immersed natural cooled ); temperature rise over 60 ºC . Load loss ≤ 7 kW . Percentage impedance 4.50% Calculate: Efficiency at 75 °C on full load,75% load and 50% load at unity power factor; regulation on full load at 75 °C at unity power factor and at 0.8 power factor lagging.
